# Learning-JAVA

Java was designed so applications can be executed on any platform that supports JAVA
without having to be recompiled.

A repository of learning the basics of JAVA for Interview Questions

Basics of Java Programming

* Basic data types( int, double, boolean)
* Create and assign the value of a given variable
* Create your own functions and use them

Basics of Programming
* Understand how to run a Programming
* Basic understanding of data structures
* Familiarity with a text editor
* Familiarity with an integrated development environment

#Interviewing is an important skill to development

There are both culture-fit and technical interviews
Ability to answer technical questions is essential

# Types of Questions for Java Devs

Java Language
Object-oriented Programming
Algorithms
Data structures

Always Be ready
* Continually enhance your skills, build your brand, and expand your knowledge
* Work on personal projects, run through example technical questions, and review key
concepts

# The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
* For the JVM to work, it has to be implemented on a given platform according to the Java Virtual Machine
specifications

* An abstract machine that can be mapped to any platform
* It described a set of instructions, registers, stack, heap, and method area

Once the specification and JVM have been implemented for a given platform, any Java program can run on that platform

* JVM provides a platform-independent way of executing code
* No JVM implementation is the same
* No major effects on your programs

# The Java Runtime Environment(JRE) and the Java Development Kit(JDK)

It allows you to create and run Java Programs

* The JRE contains the JVM, as well as browser plug-ins for executing Java applets
* The JRE is what you need to run a Java Program
* The JDK is a full-featured software development kit for Java, including the JRE, as well as compilers,
debuggers, and tools to create Programs
* The JDK is what you need to develop Java Programs
* In order to use an IDE, you must have the JDK already installed

# Class Vs. Instance

class Dog
* Attributes: string breed, int age, string color
* Methods: bark()

Dog A
* Breed:"German Shepherd", Age: 3,Color: Brown \newline
Dog B
* Breed: "Golden Retriever",Age: 5, Color: Golden

* Dog A and Dog B both have a breed, age, and color,but the values of these different attributes are
different
* Each dog can call the bark method
* Dog A and Dog B would be instances of the Dog Class.
